# Challenge-2-Advanced-CSS

## Description 

This week I was challenged with creating a professional portfolio from scratch.

While creating my site, I found that my biggest challenges came with Git. I am still having trouble figuring the whole site out, but this was definitely good practice. I also found a lot of joy in understanding and implementing flex box, it's the simple things, am I right?

Overall this was a fun project, and it showed me how fun, and relatively simple, it can be to make your own beautiful site.
